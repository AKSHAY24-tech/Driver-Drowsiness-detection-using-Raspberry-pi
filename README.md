# Driver-Drowsiness-detection-using-Raspberry-pi

<h3> Using Opencv, RaspberryPi and ML Algortithms </h3>


As part of B. Tech End Sem Project (4th Semester, team of four), we used different machine learning libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, imutils and we used raspberry Pi, to achieve an accuracy of 95.6% in detecting drowsiness and yawn of a human face. I was responsible for the implementation and programming part like I implemented this project using raspberry pi and the above-mentioned machine learning libraries.
